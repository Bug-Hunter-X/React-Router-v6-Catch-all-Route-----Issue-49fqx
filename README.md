# React Router v6 Catch-all Route Issue

This repository demonstrates an uncommon issue encountered when using the catch-all route (`*`) in React Router v6.  The problem arises when the catch-all route unexpectedly intercepts all navigation attempts, even if other more specific routes exist.

The `App.js` file contains the buggy code, and `AppSolution.js` provides a fix.
